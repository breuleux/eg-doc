[arith = Redefining arithmetic] --->
  doc =

    You may redefine arithmetic operators as you see fit. The
    modifications are only valid in the scope where they are defined.

  code =
    ;; Look! I'm redefining addition! (locally)
    100 + 10 where
       a + b = a - b

[curry = Currying] --->
  doc =

    Currying

  code =
    ;; Currying a function using an external library
    ;; This could take a few seconds to load, be patient    
    require: lodash -> curry
    curry! add(x, y) =
       x + y
    {1, 2, 3}.map(add(10))


[markdown = Markdown] --->
  doc =

    Let's display some Markdown@@{L1}~! It is really quite simple,
    first import the `markdown package, generate the HTML with `parse,
    and use `[raw % html] to render it.

    L1 => http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

  code =
    ;; Parsing and displaying Markdown
    ;; This could take a few seconds to load, be patient
    require: markdown -> parse
    grocery-list = """
    Grocery list
    ------------
    * Potatoes
    * Rice
    * SPAM
    """
    div[raw] % parse(grocery-list)


[multiplication = A multiplication table] --->
  doc =

    The `[%] operator in Earl Grey can be used to build HTML. So let's
    generate a multiplication table!

  code =

    ;; Multiplication table
    table % 1..10 each i ->
       tr % 1..10 each j ->
          td % i * j


[flot = Plotting with flot] --->
  doc =

    This code will draw a nice plot using flot@@{L1}.
    `require will not work here, unfortunately, but
    we can still load the scripts.

    L1 => http://www.flotcharts.org/

  code =

    ;; Plotting with flot
    ;; This could take a few seconds to load, be patient
    load "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"
    load "http://www.flotcharts.org/flot/jquery.flot.js"
    globals: $
    $out.elem.style.height = "500px" ;; making room
    $.plot($out.elem) with {
       1..100 each i -> {i, Math.sin(i / 10)}
       1..100 each i -> {i, Math.sin(i / 10 - 1)}
       1..100 each i -> {i, Math.sin(i / 10) + 0.25}

[paint = Crappy Paint] --->
